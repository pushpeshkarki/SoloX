# Advanced Device Management Features

## Overview

The SoloX advanced device management system provides a comprehensive suite of tools for managing multiple mobile devices efficiently. These features are designed to help automate device management tasks, monitor device health, and ensure optimal performance.

## Features

### 1. Batch Operations

The `BatchOperationManager` allows you to execute operations across multiple devices simultaneously.

```python
from solox.device_management.advanced_features import BatchOperationManager

# Initialize
batch_manager = BatchOperationManager(device_pool)

# Execute batch operation
result = await batch_manager.execute_batch(
    operation="install_app",
    params={"app_path": "path/to/app.apk"},
    devices=["device1", "device2"]
)
```

Key features:
- Parallel execution using thread pools
- Automatic error handling and reporting
- Configurable device targeting

### 2. Health Monitoring

The `HealthMonitor` continuously tracks device health metrics and alerts on issues.

```python
from solox.device_management.advanced_features import HealthMonitor

# Initialize
health_monitor = HealthMonitor(device_pool)

# Check device health
health = await health_monitor.check_device_health("device1")
print(f"Status: {health.status}")
print(f"CPU Usage: {health.cpu_usage}%")
```

Monitored metrics:
- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Battery level
- Temperature
- Connection strength

Alert thresholds:
```python
default_thresholds = {
    "cpu_usage": 90.0,      # Percentage
    "memory_usage": 90.0,   # Percentage
    "battery_level": 15.0,  # Percentage
    "temperature": 45.0,    # Celsius
    "connection_strength": 30.0  # Percentage
}
```

### 3. Automatic Recovery

The `AutoRecovery` system automatically detects and attempts to fix device issues.

```python
from solox.device_management.advanced_features import AutoRecovery

# Initialize
auto_recovery = AutoRecovery(device_pool, health_monitor)

# Check and recover if needed
success = await auto_recovery.check_and_recover("device1")
```

Recovery steps:
1. For high resource usage (CPU/Memory > 90%):
   - Restart problematic apps
2. For poor connection (strength < 30%):
   - Attempt reconnection
3. For critical errors:
   - Reboot device

Configuration:
- Maximum recovery attempts: 3 (configurable)
- Recovery history tracking
- Automatic escalation

### 4. Performance Profiling

The `PerformanceProfiler` collects and analyzes device performance metrics.

```python
from solox.device_management.advanced_features import PerformanceProfiler

# Initialize
profiler = PerformanceProfiler(device_pool)

# Start profiling
metrics = await profiler.start_profiling("device1", duration=60)
```

Collected metrics:
- Response time
- Throughput
- Error rate
- Historical trends

Features:
- Configurable profiling duration
- Historical data retention (last 1000 records)
- Real-time metrics collection

### 5. Custom Device Profiles

The `ProfileManager` allows creating and applying custom device configurations.

```python
from solox.device_management.advanced_features import ProfileManager

# Initialize
profile_manager = ProfileManager()

# Create profile
high_performance = profile_manager.create_profile(
    name="high_performance",
    settings={
        "performance_mode": True,
        "cpu_governor": "performance",
        "keep_alive": True
    },
    compatibility=["iPhone.*", "Pixel.*"],
    performance_targets={
        "response_time": 0.1,
        "throughput": 1000,
        "error_rate": 0.001
    }
)

# Apply profile
success = profile_manager.apply_profile("device1", "high_performance", device_pool)
```

Profile features:
- Device compatibility checking
- Performance targets
- Customizable settings
- Automatic validation

## Integration Example

Here's a complete example of using all features together:

```python
async def manage_devices(device_ids):
    # Initialize components
    device_pool = DevicePool()
    batch_manager = BatchOperationManager(device_pool)
    health_monitor = HealthMonitor(device_pool)
    auto_recovery = AutoRecovery(device_pool, health_monitor)
    profiler = PerformanceProfiler(device_pool)
    profile_manager = ProfileManager()

    # Create and apply profile
    profile_manager.create_profile(...)
    
    # Monitor and manage devices
    while True:
        # Check health
        health = await health_monitor.check_device_health(device_id)
        
        # Recover if needed
        if health.status != "healthy":
            await auto_recovery.check_and_recover(device_id)
        
        # Collect performance metrics
        metrics = await profiler._collect_metrics(device_id)
        
        # Execute batch operations
        await batch_manager.execute_batch(...)
        
        await asyncio.sleep(10)
```

## Best Practices

1. Error Handling
   - Always wrap device operations in try-except blocks
   - Log errors with appropriate context
   - Implement graceful degradation

2. Resource Management
   - Close resources in finally blocks
   - Use context managers when possible
   - Clean up thread pools properly

3. Performance
   - Use batch operations for multiple devices
   - Implement appropriate polling intervals
   - Cache device information when possible

4. Monitoring
   - Set appropriate alert thresholds
   - Implement logging for all operations
   - Track historical data for analysis

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. Device Connection Issues
   ```python
   # Check connection strength
   health = await health_monitor.check_device_health(device_id)
   if health.connection_strength < 30:
       await device.reconnect()
   ```

2. High Resource Usage
   ```python
   # Monitor and restart if needed
   if health.cpu_usage > 90 or health.memory_usage > 90:
       await device.restart_apps()
   ```

3. Profile Compatibility
   ```python
   # Check before applying
   if device.model not in profile.compatibility:
       logger.warning("Incompatible profile")
   ```
